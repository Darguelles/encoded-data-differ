# Use OpenApi 3

## Context
Thew application must be documented and able to test the endpoints interactively in order to make sure is working as 
expected.

## Decision
Use OpenApi v3 because provide a good set of automation for generate the documentation. The tool offers more 
capabilities such generate server code, client code and so on, but for this challenge I've just considered it to 
document and resource versioning. Other very interesting features proposed for future improvements are:

- Collaboration: Providing just one `openapi.yml` file we are able to generate server and client code, making easier
  to collaborate with external teams under a single API contract.
- Maintainability: In case we need to update the contract definition, just update the yml file. It allows developers
to focus on business implementation instead of API boilerplate.
